    title: "The Night Journey (Isra and Miraj)",
    chapter: "Isra and Miraj",
    shortDescription:
      "The miraculous journey from Mecca to Jerusalem and then to the heavens.",
    date: "Mar 17, 621 CE",
    ayahAbove:
      "Exalted is He who took His Servant by night from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him of Our signs. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Seeing.",
    ayahAboveSource: "Quran 17:1",
    ayahBelow:
      "And We certainly gave Moses the Torah and sent after him successive messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Pure Spirit.",

    content:
      "The Night Journey (Isra and Miraj) came at a time when the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was enduring deep sorrow and hardship. He had lost his beloved wife Khadijah and his uncle Abu Talib, and the people of Mecca continued to reject his message with hostility. In this moment of trial, Allah honored His Messenger with a journey unlike any other.\n\nIn the Isra, the Prophet was taken from the Kaaba in Mecca to Masjid al-Aqsa in Jerusalem upon the heavenly steed Buraq. There, he led all of the previous prophets in prayer, symbolizing the unity and continuation of the divine message.\n\nThen began the Miraj, the ascension through the heavens. At each level, the Prophet met earlier messengers: Adam in the first heaven, Isa (Jesus) and Yahya (John) in the second, Yusuf in the third, Idris in the fourth, Harun in the fifth, Musa in the sixth, and Ibrahim in the seventh, leaning against al-Bayt al-Ma‘mur — a place of constant worship by angels. Finally, the Prophet was brought to the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary (Sidrat al-Muntaha), a place beyond which none may pass.\n\nIt was here that Allah prescribed the five daily prayers, a gift and a mercy for the Prophet’s ummah. This miraculous journey was not just a sign for the Prophet, but a reminder for all believers of Allah’s power, mercy, and nearness.\n\nIsra and Miraj became a source of hope, elevating the Prophet’s spirit and strengthening his resolve. It remains a reminder that after hardship comes ease, and that prayer is the believer’s direct connection to Allah.",

    title: "The Migration to Medina (Hijra)",
    chapter: "Hijra",
    shortDescription:
      "The Prophet's journey from Mecca to Medina, marking the beginning of the Islamic calendar.",
    date: "Jul 16, 622 CE",
    ayahAbove:
      "And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many locations and abundance. And whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to Allah and His Messenger and then death overtakes him, his reward has already become incumbent upon Allah.",
    ayahAboveSource: "Quran 4:100",
    ayahBelow:
      "If you do not aid him, Allah has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out as one of two, when they were in the cave and he said to his companion, 'Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us.'",
    ayahBelowSource: "Quran 9:40",
    content:
      "The Hijra (Migration) was not simply a relocation — it was the dawn of a new era. In Mecca, Muslims had endured years of persecution, torture, and boycott. When the people of Yathrib (later known as Medina) invited the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to their city to serve as a leader and peacemaker, it was a divine opening.\n\nThe migration was carried out in secrecy. Muslims left Mecca in small groups, slipping away under cover of night. The Prophet remained behind until Allah gave him permission to depart. Quraysh had plotted to assassinate him, surrounding his house with swords in hand. But Allah protected His Messenger: young Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) slept in the Prophet’s bed that night, confusing the assassins, while the Prophet escaped with Abu Bakr.\n\nTheir journey was filled with danger. They hid in the cave of Thawr for three days, while Quraysh searched tirelessly. Spiders spun webs and pigeons nested at the cave’s mouth, deceiving the pursuers. When Abu Bakr felt fear, the Prophet reassured him with the timeless words: *“Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us.”*\n\nUpon arrival in Medina, the Prophet was greeted with immense joy. Brotherhood was established between the emigrants (Muhajirun) and the helpers (Ansar). A just constitution was drawn up, uniting Muslims, Jews, and tribes under one community. The Hijra was not only a physical migration but a migration from oppression to freedom, from despair to hope, and from weakness to strength.\n\nThis event marked the foundation of the Islamic calendar and the beginning of an era where the faith would flourish.",

    chapter: "Exodus from Egypt",
    shortDescription:
      "The miraculous escape of the Children of Israel from Pharaoh's army.",
    date: "Apr 10, 1312 BCE",
    ayahAbove:
      "And We inspired to Moses, 'Travel by night with My servants; indeed, you will be pursued.' Then Pharaoh sent among the cities gatherers. And We revealed to Moses, 'Strike the sea with your staff.' And it parted, and each portion was like a great towering mountain.",
    ayahAboveSource: "Quran 26:52-63",
    ayahBelow:
      "And We took the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them in tyranny and enmity until, when drowning overtook him, he said, 'I believe that there is no deity except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims.'",
    ayahBelowSource: "Quran 10:90",
    content:
      "Prophet Musa (peace be upon him) was chosen by Allah to lead the Children of Israel out of bondage after years of slavery under Pharaoh. The tyrant had defied Allah’s signs and hardened his heart despite plague after plague sent as warnings.\n\nAt last, Allah commanded Musa to lead his people away under the cover of night. But Pharaoh’s army pursued them relentlessly. As the Children of Israel reached the shores of the Red Sea, terror gripped them. The waves towered before them, and Pharaoh’s soldiers closed in from behind.\n\nIn this moment of despair, Musa’s unwavering faith shone. Allah inspired him: *“Strike the sea with your staff.”* As his staff touched the water, the sea split apart, rising like towering mountains on either side. A dry path appeared, wide enough for all to cross. The people hurried through, hearts pounding with awe and relief.\n\nWhen Pharaoh and his army charged into the path, the walls of the sea collapsed, swallowing them whole. In his final moments, Pharaoh declared belief, but it was too late. His body was left as a sign for generations to come.\n\nThis miracle displayed Allah’s absolute power over creation and His protection of those who trust in Him. For the Children of Israel, it was the beginning of liberation and a journey toward the Promised Land. For believers, it remains a timeless reminder that no tyranny lasts and that deliverance comes to those who hold firm to Allah.",

    shortDescription:
      "The miraculous birth of Prophet Isa (Jesus) to Maryam (Mary).",
    date: "Dec 25, 5 BCE",
    ayahAbove:
      "And mention Maryam in the Book, when she withdrew from her family to an eastern place. And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Angel, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.",
    ayahAboveSource: "Quran 19:16-17",
    ayahBelow:
      "He will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity and will be of the righteous.",
    ayahBelowSource: "Quran 3:46",
    content:
      "Maryam (peace be upon her) was a woman of unmatched devotion and purity. She spent her days in worship, secluded from the distractions of the world. It was during one of these moments of retreat that the Angel Jibril appeared to her in human form, bringing her news that would astonish all of creation.\n\nHe told her: *“I am only the messenger of your Lord to grant you a pure boy.”* Maryam was struck with fear and amazement, for she was untouched by any man. But the angel assured her that this was a command from Allah, who creates whatever He wills.\n\nBurdened with the weight of this miraculous pregnancy, Maryam withdrew from her people. Alone and in pain beneath a palm tree, she cried out. But Allah comforted her: fresh dates fell from the tree, and a stream of water appeared at her feet. Soon, she gave birth to Isa (Jesus), one of the greatest prophets.\n\nWhen she returned carrying her newborn, the people accused her. In response, the infant Isa miraculously spoke from the cradle: *“Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.”* This sign silenced the accusers and established Isa’s mission from birth.\n\nThe story of Isa’s birth is not only a miracle but a powerful reminder of Allah’s ability to create beyond human understanding. It emphasizes faith, purity, and trust in Allah’s wisdom. Isa grew to be a prophet who would call people to worship Allah alone, continuing the chain of guidance given to humanity.",
